Postmortem: GitHub Octoverse Outage (October 2021)

*Issue Summary:*

* *Duration:* The GitHub Octoverse, a highly anticipated annual report showcasing developer trends, experienced an outage on Thursday, October 21st, 2021, from approximately 16:00 PST to 20:00 PST (four hours).
* *Impact:* Users attempting to access the Octoverse website encountered error messages and were unable to view the report's data and visualizations. This impacted a significant portion of the GitHub user base eager to explore the year's developer landscape.

*Timeline:*

* *16:00 PST:*  A surge in user traffic hit the Octoverse website as developers flocked to see the newly released report.
* *16:05 PST:*  Monitoring alerts indicated a significant increase in response times and error rates for the Octoverse website.
* *16:10 PST:*  The on-call engineers were notified and began investigating the issue.
* *16:15 PST:*  Initial investigation focused on potential scaling issues as the traffic exceeded expectations.
* *16:30 PST:*  Scaling measures were implemented, including spinning up additional servers to handle the increased load.
* *17:00 PST:*  While scaling helped, the website remained unstable with intermittent errors. Further investigation revealed a database bottleneck. 
* *17:30 PST:*  The engineering team identified an inefficient database query causing performance issues. They implemented an optimized query to improve database response times.
* *18:00 PST:*  Website performance began to stabilize with fewer errors reported.
* *19:00 PST:*  The engineering team continued monitoring and fine-tuning the database configuration.
* *20:00 PST:*  The Octoverse website was declared fully operational, handling user traffic smoothly.

*Root Cause and Resolution:*

The root cause of the outage was a combination of factors. The unexpected surge in user traffic overwhelmed the existing infrastructure, leading to scaling issues. Additionally, an inefficient database query further exacerbated the problem, causing performance bottlenecks. Scaling the infrastructure and optimizing the database query resolved the immediate issues and restored website functionality.

*Corrective and Preventative Measures:*

* *Improved Traffic Forecasting:*  GitHub implemented more sophisticated traffic forecasting models to better anticipate user surges for major events like the Octoverse release.
* *Database Performance Optimization:*  A database performance review was conducted to identify and address potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
* *Infrastructure Auto-Scaling:*  Investigations began into implementing an auto-scaling mechanism for the Octoverse website to automatically adjust resources based on real-time traffic demands.
* *Communication and Transparency:*  Emphasis was placed on improving communication during outages. Public status updates were provided to keep users informed about the situation and the progress towards resolution.

*Lessons Learned:*

The Octoverse outage highlighted the importance of robust infrastructure scaling and proactive performance optimization, especially for anticipated high-traffic events.  Additionally, clear communication with the user base during outages is crucial for maintaining trust and minimizing frustration.
